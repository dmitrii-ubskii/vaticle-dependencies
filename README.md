# TypeDB Dependencies

[![Factory](https://factory.vaticle.com/api/status/vaticle/dependencies/badge.svg)](https://factory.vaticle.com/vaticle/dependencies)

Bazel dependencies and build tools for [@typedb](https://github.com/typedb) repositories.

> This is a publicly accessible repository, and you are free to take inspirations from it. However, **we are not maintaining this codebase for public usage** outside of [@typedb](https://github.com/typedb). We will definitely be making changes to it that are specific to [@typedb](https://github.com/typedb), and this may break your build system if you depend on this repository from outside of [@typedb](https://github.com/typedb).
